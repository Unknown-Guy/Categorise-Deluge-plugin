If you already have Categorise at version prior to 0.3.2, you should remove Categorise config file:
rm $HOME/.config/deluge/categorise.conf

In order to send notification through Jabber you have to install pyxmpp libraries.

See INSTALL for more details.

P.S. I made minor changes which suited my needs (e.g. improved heuristics,
     removed data category, added tv category).
